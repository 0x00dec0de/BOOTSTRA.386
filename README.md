### Configuration

Javascript settings are set via a global `_386` object.

#### Animation
The loading animation can be configured through the following values:

  * fastLoad `[bool]` (default: false) - disable all animation.
  * onePass `[bool]` (default: false) - when set, this will disable the second flyby cursor
  * speedFactor `[float]` (default: 1.0) - This controls how fast the animation happens. Higher values mean faster animation.

Example:

    _386 = { onePass: true, speedFactor: 1.25 };

> Note: For the progressive animation to work you may need to set this stanza in your regular CSS: `body { visibility: hidden }`.
