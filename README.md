# [Demo Site](http://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/)

### Download the current [bootstrap.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386/master/docs/assets/css/bootstrap.css) and [bootstrap-responsive.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386/master/docs/assets/css/bootstrap-responsive.css) to use it right away.

## Less fun intro

Bootstrap/386 is a [Twitter bootstrap v2](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) theme intended to make
webpages look like they are from the 1980s. 

### Status

I've been working on this more or less for a year or so --- there's a lot to do. If you'd like to contribute,
please try to hack the components section.

Here's some rules:

  * All text must be vertically aligned.  The letters should start at the same horizontal offset down the page, as a grid
  * All text must be horizontally aligned.  Borders, margins, and paddings must be a function of the height of the font or
    the height of the font / 2 if you are doing some special ASCII-like thing.
  * Foreground colors can be any of the EGA 16 - background can only be the first 8.
  * Things like shadows, darken, lighten, border-radius, underline, italics, bold - none of this is allowed.

There is more written up in [the wiki](https://github.com/kristopolous/BOOTSTRA.386/wiki/).

### Filing Bugs

Preferably, I like a screen shot and context. Here's an example of a good bug:

> The calculations for a span4 are done in a way that centering text doesn't follow the grid rules:

These are how I knock them out when I work on it.  Thanks
